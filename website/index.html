			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
			I'm a Software Engineer at Motorola Solutions, creating highly available, distributed applications to handle low-latency audio. 
			I've focused on implementing seamless, zero-downtime upgrades of mission-critical systems. 
			I graduated from Northern Illinois University in 2019 with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business Administration. 
			In my free time, I enjoy running, rock climbing, Latin dance, and trying new restaurants.
